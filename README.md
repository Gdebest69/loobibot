# Installation

## Install any requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Any python versions which are 3.9 and above should work.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install the repository and necessary libraries

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Gdebest69/loobibot.git`
2. Go to the root directory: `cd loobibot`
3. Install necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. I currently use this version of discord.py: https://github.com/Gdebest69/discord.py/tree/voice-status-rest
5. There are a few missing files and folders which are essential for this repository to work, so you will have to personally ask me for them.
6. To run or test the bot, make sure you run `main.py` with the `-test` argument. This is for the tasks in `extensions/tasks.py` to not run. You can remove the `-test` argument if you know what you are doing.
